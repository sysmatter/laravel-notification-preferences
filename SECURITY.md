# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

**Note:** We typically support the current major version and the previous major version. Once a new major version is
released, we'll provide security updates for the previous version for a limited time.
